3
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,384
You did this.
You did this!

4
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:03,670
- We have to leave.
- Cersei:<i> Take him! Take him!</i>

5
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,425
Where is his wife?

6
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,407
Where's Sansa?

7
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,771
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

8
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:15,274
<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

9
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,827
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

10
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,862
<i>No one!</i>

11
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,082
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

12
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,393
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

13
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:52,228
Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,408
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,662
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

17
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,381
( gasps )

18
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,302
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,378
( snaps fingers )

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,165
Wait!
( groans )

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,533
( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856

one true king of Westeros.

But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

You a fucking wildling?

- Only room and board?

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,775
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

796
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:21,179
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

800
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:25,716
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

801
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:28,156
Do I have a champion?

_

806
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:41,705
Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

807
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:44,068
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

808
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,538
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

809
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:49,207
Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

811
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,212
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

812
00:50:54,246 --> 00:50:56,080
I will not gamble
with your life.

813
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,416
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

815
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:02,086
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

816
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:05,139
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

817
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:07,809
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,679
Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

821
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,499
Make it worth their while.

822
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,041
He is very brave, Your Grace.

823
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,791
Yes, win or lose,

824
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,262
<i>as long as the whole</i>
<i>city is watching.</i>

825
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:39,659
You sure you don't want a horse?

826
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:41,444
Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

827
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,996
Horses are faster than men.

00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:46,949
Horses are dumber than men.

Where is his wife?

Good. Good.

I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457

- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

They don't have enough men

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710

Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

384
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,548
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

385
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433

"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767

- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510

<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513

When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:21,179
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

Let me stand for you
today as well.

You are my most trusted advisor,

I will not gamble

Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

Let me kill this man for you.

Very well.

Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

Good. Good.

Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32

You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781

He says that we're an army

795
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,775
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

796
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:21,179
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

808

I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

809

Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

812

I will not gamble

813
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,416
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

of your Unsullied.

My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818

Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

Make it worth their while.

He is very brave, Your Grace.

Yes, win or lose,

Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

Horses are faster than men.

Why did you kill him?

Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65

of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67

to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

<i>( door closes )</i>

- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612

This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

Pod.

708

There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285

715

Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:21,179
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

this one to be quiet.

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

Let me stand for you

Daario: I was the last

00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,407
Where's Sansa?

7
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,771
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

8
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:15,274
<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

9
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,827
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

10
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,862
<i>No one!</i>

11
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,082
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

12
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,393
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

13
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:52,228
Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,408
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,662
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

17
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,381
( gasps )

18
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,302
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,378
( snaps fingers )

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,165
Wait!
( groans )

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,533
( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

385
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819

No.

Where's the daddy?

North of here?

475

You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582

00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

He claims you are no woman

796
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799

I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

800
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:25,716
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

801
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:28,156
Do I have a champion?

802

_

806
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:41,705
Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

807
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:44,068
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

808
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,538
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

809
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:49,207
Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

811
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,212
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

812
00:50:54,246 --> 00:50:56,080
I will not gamble
with your life.

813
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,416
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

815
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:02,086
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

816
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:05,139
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

817
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:07,809
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,679
Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

821
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,499
Make it worth their while.

822
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,041
He is very brave, Your Grace.

823
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,791
Yes, win or lose,

824
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,262
<i>as long as the whole</i>
<i>city is watching.</i>

825
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:39,659
You sure you don't want a horse?

826
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:41,444
Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

827
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,996
Horses are faster than men.

828
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:46,949
Horses are dumber than men.

You'll be fine.

Good. Good.

I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756

Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

He claims you are no woman

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799

I have something to say

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

Let me stand for you

Daario: I was the last

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

384
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,548
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

385
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465

00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.

518

00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754

<i>( horn blows )</i>

Rangers returning.

756

Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

hides his cock

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

I have something to say

You did this!

- We have to leave.
- Cersei:<i> Take him! Take him!</i>

00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,425
Where is his wife?

Where's Sansa?

7
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,771
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

<i>( bells tolling )</i>

- Where are we going?

Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,408
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,662
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081

- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

Your Grace.

You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

<i>I said those words when I

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

They don't have enough men

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420

I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

He claims you are no woman

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city

I have something to say

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

I've been by your side longer

Let me stand for you

810

You are my most trusted advisor,

I will not gamble

Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818

Let me kill this man for you.

Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067

He is very brave, Your Grace.

Daario: <i> Why would

Why did you kill him?

44

Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049

body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884

What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

384
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,548
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

385
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523

<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

<i>( door closes )</i>

- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650

( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756

Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

I have something to say

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

Let me stand for you

Daario: I was the last

00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:52,228
Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,408
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,662
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

17
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,381
( gasps )

18
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,302
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,378
( snaps fingers )

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,165
Wait!
( groans )

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,533
( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383

<i>( door closes )</i>

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819

No.

Where's the daddy?

00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

North of here.

North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484

You'll be safer here.

00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489

them in the back

00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

807
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:44,068
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

808
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,538
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

809
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:49,207
Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

811
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,212
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

812
00:50:54,246 --> 00:50:56,080
I will not gamble
with your life.

813
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,416
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

815
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:02,086
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

816
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:05,139
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

817
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:07,809
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,679
Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

821
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,499
Make it worth their while.

822
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,041
He is very brave, Your Grace.

823
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,791
Yes, win or lose,

824
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,262
<i>as long as the whole</i>

You sure you don't want a horse?

826
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:41,444
Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

827
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,996
Horses are faster than men.

Horses are dumber than men.

Good. Good.

I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383

Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421

You're late.

I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799

I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

Let me stand for you
today as well.

Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814

I'm not your general or a

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

Very well.

820

00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

384
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,548
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

385
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465

00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709

Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719

( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797

Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798

They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

I have something to say

You did this.
You did this!

- We have to leave.
- Cersei:<i> Take him! Take him!</i>

5
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,425
Where is his wife?

6

Where's Sansa?

7
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:11,771
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

<i>Seize every ship in the harbor.</i>

<i>( bells tolling )</i>

- Where are we going?

00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:52,228
Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,408
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,662
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

17
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,381
( gasps )

18
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,302
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,378

00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,165

( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081

00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777

Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

He says that we're an army

795
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,775
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

796
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799

I have something to say

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

808

I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

812

I will not gamble

813

Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

of your Unsullied.

My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,679
Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

Make it worth their while.

822

He is very brave, Your Grace.

Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

Horses are faster than men.

Why did you kill him?

Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43

44

He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

<i>Money buys a man's</i>

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,411
<i>( door closes )</i>

384
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,548

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

433
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,992
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

434
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,361
First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819
( baby cooing )

463
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,158
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

464
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,716
<i>( people laughing, chatting )</i>

465
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,847
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

466
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,767
- What's his name?
- Sam.

467
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,485
Lovely.

468
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
That the daddy?

469
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,488
No.

470
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,023
Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,529
Oh. Where you from?

473
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
North of here.

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,501
North of here?

475
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,541
You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,137
You'll be safer here.

485
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,532
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

491
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,819
( baby crying )

492
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,856
You have to trust me.

493
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

<i>( door closes )</i>

- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650

( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,728
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

799

I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

Which is why you must
remain by my side.

I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

Let me stand for you
today as well.

810

Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

I come from nothing.

And before long,
I will return to nothing.

Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067

00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,581
You're stronger than you know.

17
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,381
( gasps )

18
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,302
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

19
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,387
Are you hurt, my lady?

20
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,139
Good. Good.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,025
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,977
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:17,613
-<i> I promised I'd get her to you safely.</i>
- Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,282
Voices carry over water.

25
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,319
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,371
First you'll want your pay.

27
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,207
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,378
( snaps fingers )

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:36,165
Wait!
( groans )

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,533
( screams )

31
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,552
Littlefinger: <i> Shh.</i>

32
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,470
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

33
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,140
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

34
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,008
And if they found you,

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,728
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

36
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:53,115
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,350
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

38
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,485
The king who
executed your father,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,737
who tormented you for years,

40
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:01,524
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

41
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,692
Why did you kill him?

42
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:06,495
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,365
and I don't trust drunk fools.

44
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,634
He saved me.

45
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,620
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

46
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:19,041
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

47
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,727
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

48
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,097
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

49
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,269
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

50
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

51
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,526
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

52
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,613
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

53
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,407
I had it made a few weeks ago.

54
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,661
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

55
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,380
We're all liars here.

56
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,084
Come, my lady.

57
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:04,753
I know you've had
a difficult day.

58
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,922
But you're safe now.

59
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:09,091
I promise you that.

60
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,260
You're safe with me

61
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,929
and sailing home.

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,655
So am I the queen?

63
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,440
More than you were with Renly.

64
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,576
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

65
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,529
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

66
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,782
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

67
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,701
to press the issue.

68
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,586
Clawing at his own throat,

69
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,456
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

70
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,008
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

71
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,403
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

72
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,049
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,884
Made me look at it.

74
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,469
What was it like?

75
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,639
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

76
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,524
The man I'd married

77
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,810
and suffered to father
my children.

78
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,063
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

79
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,483
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

80
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,119
There he was...

81
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,539
lying on a table.

82
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,961
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

83
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,663
and was stabbed
through the heart.

84
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,048
Another was happiest
torturing animals

85
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,334
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

86
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

87
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,256
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

88
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,893
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

89
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,762
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

90
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,764
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

91
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,899
But I would have been the queen.

92
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,818
Our alliance with the Lannisters

93
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,437
remains every bit
as necessary to them

94
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,940
as it is unpleasant for us.

95
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,943
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

96
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,029
The next one should be easier.

97
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,674
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

98
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,045
Do you know what that means?

99
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:15,684
I'm not trying to trick you.

100
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,854
It means I'll become king.

101
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,273
Yes, you will become king.

102
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,560
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

103
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,363
A good king?

104
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,732
Mm, I think so as well.

105
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,286
You've got the right
temperament for it.

106
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,123
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

107
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,577
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

108
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,746
This is hardly
the place or the time.

109
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,748
Holiness?

110
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Hmm.

111
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,253
<i>Baelor the Blessed was holy.</i>

112
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,505
And pious.

113
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,141
He built this sept.

114
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:59,478
He also named a six-year-old
boy high septon

115
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,815
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

116
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,902
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

117
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,056
because food was of this world

118
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,273
and this world was sinful.

119
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,244
Justice.

120
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,995
Yeah.

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,331
A good king must be just.

122
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,201
Orys, the 1st, was just.

123
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,704
Everyone applauded his reforms.

124
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,756
Nobles and commoners alike.

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,925
But he wasn't just for long.

126
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,960
He was murdered in his sleep

127
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,263
after less than a year
by his own brother.

128
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:37,516
Was that truly just of him?

129
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,802
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

130
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,970
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

131
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,356
- No.
- No.

132
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,611
- What about strength?
- Yes.

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,980
Strength.

134
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,149
King Robert was strong.

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,702
He won the rebellion

136
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:00,322
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

137
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:03,242
And he attended three
small council meetings

138
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,127
in 17 years.

139
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,665
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

140
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,167
until the last two killed him.

141
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

142
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:20,175
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

143
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:23,846
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

144
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,901
What do they all lack?

145
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,190
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

146
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,276
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

147
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,911
Yes.

148
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,663
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

150
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,337
<i>asks you for your protection</i>

151
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,340
against another house
with a strong navy

152
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,759
that could one day oppose you.

153
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,262
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

154
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:01,216
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

155
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,352
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

156
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,388
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

157
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,892
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

158
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,643
You're young.

159
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:15,147
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

160
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,817
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,736
And the wisest kings

162
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:24,656
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

163
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Your brother was not
a wise king.

164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,912
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

165
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,797
<i>If he had been,</i>

166
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,666
perhaps he'd still be alive.

167
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:37,836
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

168
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,088
Do you understand why?

169
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,890
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

170
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,759
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

171
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,429
To further the family line.

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,766
-<i> Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

173
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:54,603
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

174
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,238
I don't think so.

175
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:59,608
It's all relatively
straightforward.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,944
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

177
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,196
You are.
You will be.

178
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,448
I'll see to that.

179
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,755
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,791
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

181
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:18,176
( snaps fingers )

182
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,781
( doors echo shut )

183
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,222
It was Tyrion.

184
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,259
He killed him.

185
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,162
He told me he would.

186
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,334
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

187
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,071
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

188
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,176
That's what he said to me.

189
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,182
You saw it.

190
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,902
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

191
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,137
I don't know what I saw.

192
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,909
Avenge him.

193
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,445
Avenge our son.

194
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,364
Kill Tyrion.

195
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,186
Tyrion's my brother.

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Our brother.</i>

197
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,624
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

198
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:41,126
I don't want a trial.

199
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,630
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

200
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,381
I want him dead.

201
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:51,352
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

202
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,689
You have to.

203
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,275
He was our son.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,645
Our baby boy.

205
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,637
( gasps )

206
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,186
You're a hateful woman.

207
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,489
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

208
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,866
Jaime, not here, please.

209
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,418
Please.

210
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,453
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

211
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,590
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

212
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,092
Stop it.
Stop.

213
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,682
Stop.

214
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,892
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( Grunts )

215
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:23,762
It's not right.
It's not right.

216
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,697
- I don't care.
- ( Crying )

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,816
- Don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,118
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

219
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,404
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

220
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,322
Gonna rain soon.

221
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,575
( urinating )

222
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,744
Where are we?

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,799
Near Fairmarket, I think.

224
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,300
You think?

225
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,668
You don't have a map?

226
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,921
- <i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

227
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,058
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

228
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,976
How far is it to the Eyrie?

229
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,846
- Far.
- And you're sure we're going the right way?

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:01,149
Believe me, girl, I want you
there as soon as I can.

231
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,985
Get my gold, be on my way.

232
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,988
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

233
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:16,581
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

235
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,538
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,090
I'd like to see Braavos one day.

237
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:27,425
Why Braavos?

238
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,094
I have friends there.

239
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:31,296
( blows )
I doubt it.

240
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:35,050
Seven blessings to you.

241
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,638
- What do you want?
- What do I want? This is my land.

242
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,439
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

243
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,060
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

244
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,732
Forgive my father.

245
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,285
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

246
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,759
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

247
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,043
He's never been the same.

248
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,467
Which house did he fight for?

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,141
The Tullys of Riverrun.

250
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,730
There's a storm coming.

251
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,265
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

252
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>There's fresh hay in the barn.</i>

253
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,687
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

254
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:32,941
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

255
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:37,838
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,424
- <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i> ( Rain pattering )</i>

257
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,927
Man: <i> We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

258
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,929
<i>accepting our human frailty.</i>

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

260
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,017
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

261
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,270
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

262
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,438
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

263
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,774
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

264
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,456
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

265
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,361
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

266
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Father!

267
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,286
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

268
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,372
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

269
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,626
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,878
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,431
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

272
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,189
I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,727
( slurping loudly )

274
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,160
Really good.

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,329
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,798
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

277
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,000
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,886
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,423
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

280
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

281
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,311
It means something to me.

282
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,847
The gods will have
their vengeance.

283
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,900
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

284
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,237
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

285
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,023
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

286
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,909
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

287
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,030
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

288
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,032
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

289
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,252
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

290
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,170
You got any ale?

291
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,290
Afraid not.

292
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,946
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

293
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,684
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

295
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,140
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

296
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,810
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

297
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,562
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

298
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,115
Sally does what she can,

299
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,284
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

300
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,453
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

301
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,622
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

302
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,959
Meaning no offense.

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,084
What'll you pay?

304
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,136
I don't have much.

305
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,806
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

306
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,811
Fair wages for fair work?

307
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,352
Fair wages for fair work.

308
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

309
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,457
- <i> ( punch lands )</i>
- <i> ( Man groans )</i>

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,876
<i>( girl screams )</i>

312
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,595
<i>( man groaning )</i>

313
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,187
- What did you do?!
- <i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

314
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,273
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

315
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,026
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

316
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,811
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,480
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

318
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,231
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

319
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,817
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

320
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,537
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

321
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,156
They'll both be dead
come winter.

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,041
Dead men don't need silver.

323
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:38,162
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,408
There's plenty worse than me.

325
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,751
I just understand
the way things are.

326
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,421
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

327
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,228
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

328
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,013
Horse thief.

329
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,349
Ninth born son.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,317
Raper.

331
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,603
Thief.
Thief and raper.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,323
There he is, Sam the Slayer.

333
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,025
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

334
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,244
- She's not a whore.
- No?

335
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,746
Maybe I'll give her a copper
tonight and find out.

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,870
They all think I'm lying.

337
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,539
About what?

338
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,874
Killing the white walker.

339
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,794
You're not lying.

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,800
But you're the only one
that saw it.

342
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,518
And they all think
you're just a--

343
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,769
A what?

344
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, a wildling.

345
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,775
My father hated that word.

346
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,196
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

347
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,031
I don't know.

348
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,118
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

349
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,632
So...

350
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,383
are you all right?

351
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,969
No one bothering you?

352
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,588
I get a lot of looks.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,756
I hear them making their jokes.

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,759
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

355
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,979
I worry about it sometimes.

356
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,265
All the time.

357
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,318
Why do you worry about it?

358
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,422
100 men, one woman.

359
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,234
They've got other things
to think about.

360
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:32,343
That's the only thing
they think about.

361
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,929
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

362
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,100
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

363
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,104
What about you?

364
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,408
What about me?

365
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,479
Gilly?

366
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,286
I worry about you.

367
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,993
Thank you.

368
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,294
For what?

369
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,663
For worrying about me.

370
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,670
I don't know
if you're safe here.

371
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,839
They're my brothers,

372
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,258
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

373
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,893
Some of them were rapers.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,729
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

375
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,183
So what are you saying?

376
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:35,607
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

377
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,497
Are you bored of me?

378
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,283
Bored of you?

379
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,752
I...

380
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,241
I want to protect you.

381
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,549
I'll get these to Hobb.

382
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,968
Keep an eye on little Sam.

383

00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,583
Your Grace.

386
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:38,753
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

387
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,483
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

388
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,854
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

389
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,656
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

390
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,075
A bastard you set free.

391
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,695
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

392
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,530
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

393
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,332
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

394
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,868
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

395
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,920
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

396
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,621
House Peasebury.

397
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,925
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

398
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,294
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

399
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,512
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

400
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,511
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

401
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,855
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

402
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to look east
for ships and men.

403
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,977
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

404
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,029
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,480
They're sellswords.

406
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,232
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

407
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,034
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

408
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,486
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

409
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,705
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

410
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,575
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

411
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,961
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

412
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,295
It's dirty on the ground.

413
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,164
We don't have any gold.

414
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,415
Not yet.

415
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,504
If I do not press my claim,

416
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,590
my claim will be forgotten.

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,177
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

418
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

419
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Which means you're
running out of time.

420
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,521
<i>( knocking )</i>

421
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,190
You're late.

422
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,741
I'm sorry, Princess.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,526
I thought you weren't coming.

424
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,196
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

425
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,866
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

426
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,368
That happened once, weeks ago.

427
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,420
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

428
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,422
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

429
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,041
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

430
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,293
But I think you can manage.

431
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,547
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

432
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,800
That's how children do it.

First Sword of Braavos."

435
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,363
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,700
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

437
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,402
You were a pirate once.

438
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,337
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

439
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,571
What's the difference?

440
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,573
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

441
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,242
you're not doing it right.

442
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,044
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

443
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,745
Your father lacks
an appreciation

444
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,048
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

445
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,250
So do the Braavosi.

446
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,918
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

447
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,754
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

448
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,092
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

449
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,929
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

450
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,681
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

451
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,183
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

452
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:43,187
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

453
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,008
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

454
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,177
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

455
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,762
It's too important for me.

456
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,965
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

457
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:15,103
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

458
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:18,856
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

459
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,391
But that's not you.

460
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,143
I need to get their attention.

461
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,896
Go on. Write.

462
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,819

No.

470

Where's the daddy?

471
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,576
He's dead.

North of here?

475

You a fucking wildling?

476
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,377
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

477
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,096
She'll clean and cook

478
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,651
and look after the other
girls' babies.

479
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,517
Could find other
work for her, too.

480
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,103
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

481
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,771
Give you a piece of it.

482
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,274
No other work.

483
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,582
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

484

You'll be safer here.

Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

486
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,426
You protected me
north of the Wall.

487
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,344
This is different.

488
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,835
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

489
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,648
and I can't just stab
them in the back

490
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,817
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

You have to trust me.

00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,524
It's for the best.

494
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,114
Best for you.

495
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,667
Oh, Gilly.

496
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,920
Please don't.

497
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,838
( baby crying )

498
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,685
( moaning )

499
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,955
Greedy.

500
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,213
No?

501
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,082
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

502
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,050
I just never acquired the taste.

503
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,670
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

504
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,390
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

505
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,512
Your loss.

506
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,186
You like them both the same?

507
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,405
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

508
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,107
Everyone has a preference.

509
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,926
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

510
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,864
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

511
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,700
The gods made this

512
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,668
and it delights me.

513
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:10,705
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

514
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,508
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

515
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,877
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

516
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,546
What are you, 25?

517
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,799
- Children.
- ( Chuckles )

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,268
Someday, if you're lucky,

519
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,053
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

520
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,139
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

521
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,559
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,696
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

523
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:38,065
<i>No one will want you anymore.</i>

524
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,319
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

525
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,322
Did you?

526
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,408
He is a prince of Dorne.

527
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,378
Girls and boys will line up

528
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,331
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

529
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,003
They will all have
to line up behind you.

530
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,589
<i>( door opens )</i>

531
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,228
- <i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

532
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,513
May we have the room?

533
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,269
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

534
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,698
Would you like to sit?

535
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,084
No, thank you.

536
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,669
Some wine?

537
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,704
<i>No, thank you.</i>

538
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,506
<i>( door closes )</i>

539
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,209
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

540
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,296
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

541
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,965
Or his grandfather.

542
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,268
An awful way to die.

543
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,470
Which way is that?

544
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,740
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

545
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
Some believe the king choked.

546
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,777
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

547
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,363
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

548
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,584
The king was poisoned.

549
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,687
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,073
I did.
This is why I know.

551
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:12,593
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

552
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,629
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

553
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,433
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

554
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,801
Rather suspicious.

555
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,720
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

556
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,222
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

557
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,508
on the day that you arrived.

558
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,809
What did you discuss?

559
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,845
You think we conspired together?

560
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,279
What did you discuss?

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,683
The death of my sister.

562
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,351
For which you blame me.

563
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,520
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

564
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,406
The Mountain follows
your orders.

565
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,024
Of course I blame you.

566
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,527
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

567
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,162
Should I be concerned?

568
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:51,782
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

569
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,368
I am a man of reason.

570
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,370
If I cut your throat today,

571
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,038
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

572
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,124
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

573
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:01,959
without their
superiors' knowledge.

574
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,512
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

575
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,264
Categorically.

576
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,859
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

577
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

578
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,793
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

579
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,153
I could arrange
for this meeting.

580
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,957
But you want
something in return.

581
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,576
There will be a trial
for my son.

582
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,661
And as custom dictates,

583
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,581
three judges
will render a verdict.

584
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,049
I will preside.

585
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,252
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

586
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,588
I would like you
to be the third.

587
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,473
Why?

588
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,010
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

589
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,930
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

590
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,134
Now they are
our strongest allies.

591
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,351
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

592
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:04,104
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

593
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,992
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

594
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,662
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

595
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:22,089
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

596
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,724
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

597
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,513
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

598
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,800
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

599
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,271
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

600
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,359
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

601
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,279
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

602
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,148
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

603
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,035
You're saying you need us?

604
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:55,155
That must be hard
for you to admit.

605
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,158
We need each other.

606
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,879
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

607
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,882
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

608
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

609
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,603
Podrick.

610
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,489
Apologies for the stench.

611
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,941
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

612
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,743
A noble effort.

613
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,079
They didn't find
the candles, though.

614
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,364
A quill, some parchment,

615
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,217
duck sausage, almonds,

616
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,337
and some hard cheese.

617
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,139
You're a good lad.

618
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:47,241
Any word of Shae?

619
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,876
I've heard nothing, my lord.

620
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,629
I suppose that's a good thing.

621
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,549
What are they saying
about me out there?

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,602
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

623
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,387
for murdering the king.

624
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,606
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

625
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,491
No, my lord.

626
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't?

627
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,063
No. Gods, no.

628
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,332
The world is a better
place without him,

629
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,567
but I had nothing to do with it.

630
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,653
I would like to think

631
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,788
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

632
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,324
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

633
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,460
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

634
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,581
Trial in a fortnight.

635
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

636
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:35,472
- Your father.
- Of course.

637
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,058
Mace Tyrell.

638
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,345
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

639
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,814
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

640
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,766
Oberyn?

641
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,102
Give it to my father.

642
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,904
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

643
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:54,191
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

644
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:57,244
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

645
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

646
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,281
<i>How generous of them.</i>

647
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,283
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

648
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,952
My lord, she's gone.

649
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,322
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her since the wedding.</i>

650
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,861
You don't think she...

651
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,801
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

652
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,770
but the girl is no assassin.

653
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,023
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

654
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,727
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

655
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,446
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

656
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,114
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

657
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,950
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

658
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,903
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

659
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,323
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

660
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,326
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,163
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

662
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,582
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

663
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,168
<i>But say what you will of Cersei,</i>

664
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,836
she loves her children.

665
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,840
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

666
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,975
Which makes it unique

667
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,378
as King's Landing murders go.

668
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:07,347
Any other witnesses, my lord?

669
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,483
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

670
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,685
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

671
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,136
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

672
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,489
I've already asked, my lord.

673
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,957
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,027
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

675
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,495
He's under
investigation himself.

676
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,998
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

677
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,584
I'll ask, my lord.

678
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,383
There's something else, my lord.

679
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,187
A man, I didn't know his face,

680
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,807
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

681
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,726
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

682
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:56,230
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

683
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:58,398
Ser Podrick Payne?

684
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,068
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

685
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,970
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

686
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,206
Are you going to
accept their offer?

687
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,075
My lord.

688
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,177
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

689
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,662
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

690
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,463
they'll choose something
less sweet.

691
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,832
You've been good to me, my lord.

692
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,384
Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

693
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,086
They'll want an answer
before that.

694
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,388
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,475
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

696
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,594
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

697
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,429
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

698
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:31,982
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

699
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,068
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

700
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,606
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

701
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:42,025
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

702
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,994
before it's too late.

703
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,612
Pod!

704
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,581
This is farewell.

705
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,669
Farewell, my lord.

706
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,505
<i>( door opens )</i>

707
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,793
Pod.

708
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,549
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

709
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,308
<i>( door closes )</i>

710
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:31,325
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

711
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,628
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

712
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:36,546
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

713
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,633
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

714
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,285
Has she got--

715
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,004
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

716
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,422
Guymon!

717
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,508
Hide.

718
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,560
Hide!

719
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,231
( screams )

720
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,650
( shouting, screaming )

721
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,191
( grunting )

722
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,530
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

723
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,399
Yes. Yes.

724
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,992
Those your parents?

725
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:58,545
Open your eyes.

726
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm going to eat them.

727
00:45:01,549 --> 00:45:03,300
Do you hear me?

728
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,003
I'm going to eat your dead mama

729
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:09,589
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

730
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,226
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

731
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,521
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach them a lesson
about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

732
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:25,822
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

733
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,607
Yarwyck: <i> Three dozen
bodies with slit throats</i>

734
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,776
<i>tossed off the top of the Wall.</i>

735
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,912
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

736
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,664
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

737
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,867
They want to draw us out,

738
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,202
pick us off a few at a time.

739
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,955
We have just over 100 men.

740
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,759
And that's including
stewards and builders.

741
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:49,296
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

742
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:53,300
We must remember our
first responsibility.

743
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:56,770
We are the watchers on the Wall.

744
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,773
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

745
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:03,894
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

746
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,863
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

747
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,320
Mance Rayder is coming.

748
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,324
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

749
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,243
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

750
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:25,506
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

751
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,743
We need to shore up Castle Black

752
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:32,213
and we need to defend the Wall.

753
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,682
<i>That is our job.</i>

754
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,436
<i>( horn blows )</i>

755
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,657
Rangers returning.

756
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:50,615
Help him.

757
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,703
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,342
What took you so long?

759
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,261
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,629
Chains.

761
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,383
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:11,135
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:47:11,186 --> 00:47:13,604
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,057
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,142
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,694
Karl's running things now.

767
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,230
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,032
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,566
We just went over this, boy.

770
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,069
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:34,125
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,630
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:42,166
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:45,636
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,307
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,727
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,313
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,766
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:01,736
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:48:03,856 --> 00:48:06,240
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,851

hides his cock
in his own asshole.

797
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,731
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

798
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:16,374
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

I have something to say

00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:49,207
Let me stand for you
today as well.

810
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,159
You are my most trusted advisor,

811
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,212
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

812
00:50:54,246 --> 00:50:56,080
I will not gamble
with your life.

813
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,416
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

814
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,835
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

815
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:02,086
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

816
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:05,139
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

817
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:07,809
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

818
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,679
Let me kill this man for you.

819
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:13,931
Very well.

820
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:16,067
You have quite an audience.

821
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,499
Make it worth their while.

822
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,041
He is very brave, Your Grace.

823
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,791
Yes, win or lose,

824
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,262
<i>as long as the whole</i>
<i>city is watching.</i>

825
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:39,659
You sure you don't want a horse?

826
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:41,444
Daario: <i> Why would
I want a horse?</i>

827
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,996
Horses are faster than men.

828
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:46,949
Horses are dumber than men.

829
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:55,791
( whinnies )

830
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:01,630
